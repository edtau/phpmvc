<h2>Web browser</h2>
<p>
    A web browser (commonly referred to as a browser)
    is a software application for retrieving, presenting,
    and traversing information resources on the World Wide Web.
    An information resource is identified by a Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI/URL) and may be a web page, image,
    video or other piece of content.
    Hyperlinks present in resources enable users
    easily to navigate their browsers to related resources.
    Although browsers are primarily intended to use the World Wide Web,
    they can also be used to access information provided by web
    servers in private networks or files in file systems.
    The major web browsers are Firefox, Internet Explorer/Microsoft Edge,
    Google Chrome, Opera, and Safari.
